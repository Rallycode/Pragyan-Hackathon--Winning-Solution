# ECO2RP: Real-Time Machine Learning for Pollution Reduction and Maximizing Environmental Impact

## Problem Statement

**Environmental Sustainability** is a pressing concern, particularly in industries with high levels of carbon emissions. With the increasing role of IT and tech-driven corporate environments, the challenge lies in accurately calculating and reducing carbon emissions in real-time while simultaneously motivating employees and organizations to engage in eco-friendly initiatives.

**Objective**: To develop a real-time machine learning system, **ECO2RP**, that helps corporates track, predict, and reduce carbon emissions by providing employees with personalized tasks and challenges aimed at offsetting and minimizing their carbon footprint.

## Proposed Solution: ECO2RP

ECO2RP is a Real-Time ML model designed to calculate and reduce the carbon emissions released by corporate organizations. The system not only tracks individual and organizational carbon output but also incentivizes employees to take action through gamified challenges and corporate-level competition for an **ECO CORP badge**.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Carbon Calculation**: The system calculates the average carbon emissions generated by employees daily based on their use of hardware and software resources.
  
- **Employee Engagement**: Employees are motivated to reduce emissions by participating in eco-friendly challenges (e.g., carpooling, using public transport, planting saplings). Success in these tasks earns them personal rewards and contributes to corporate goals.
  
- **Corporate-Level Competition**: Companies can compete with one another to achieve carbon reduction targets. Those that perform best receive the **ECO CORP badge**, promoting a greener business environment.

## Solution Focus Areas

### 1. Predictive Air Quality Management

The machine learning model is trained to identify and quantify the carbon emissions associated with various corporate hardware and software usage. This includes:

- Calculating the carbon emitted per employee based on device usage, work habits, and infrastructure reliance.
- Predicting emissions trends over time to provide proactive recommendations for emission reduction.

### 2. Dynamic Resource Allocation for Environmental Initiatives

ECO2RP uses predictive analytics to identify the resources (e.g., servers, machines) contributing the most to emissions. The system dynamically allocates these resources more efficiently, ensuring that energy consumption is minimized without compromising productivity.

- **Resource-wise Carbon Prediction**: The model estimates carbon emitted by each corporate resource (computing hardware, energy usage, etc.) to allow for strategic resource management.
  
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Based on carbon output predictions, companies can dynamically allocate and manage resources to reduce their environmental impact.

### 3. Enhanced Public Awareness and Engagement

ECO2RP fosters a corporate culture of sustainability by:

- Encouraging employees to complete eco-friendly challenges that contribute directly to reducing their carbon footprint. These challenges could include:
  - **Planting trees** (carbon offset initiatives)
  - **Carpooling** or using **public transport**
  - **Switching to solar energy**
  
- Corporates are ranked and rewarded based on their collective emissions reduction, receiving the **ECO CORP badge** for sustained success.
  
- Employees' participation extends beyond the workplace, with their eco-friendly behaviors influencing families and communities, further amplifying the impact.

## Model Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - The model collects data on the hardware and software usage of employees across departments.
   - It monitors resources like energy consumption, device usage, and other factors contributing to carbon emissions.
   
2. **Real-Time Carbon Calculation**:
   - Using predefined coefficients, the model calculates the carbon output of each employee and resource in real time.
   
3. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - The model predicts future emissions based on historical trends, helping organizations make proactive decisions to mitigate environmental impact.
